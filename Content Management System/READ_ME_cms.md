## learning content management system

In order to make it easier for tutors to tack individual student learning history, assign homework problems and make student learning experience more autonomous, we created a content management system for learning.
The system provided the students a simple to use platform that could allow students to create and navigate different topics. Students could access previous practise problems and complete the work assigned by tutors in a single platform.

The CMS acted as the backbone to all newer features that were implemented later on. The learning CMS itself was not user friendly from the administrator persective - the exercise upload process was inconvenient, 
since the exercises with respective solutions and answers had to be manually uploaded to the database. Additionally, the AI systems were not yet configured to double check the exercises answers and solutions.

Nevertheless, basic learning CMS was being used by the users, where they could interact with GPT-3.5-turbo and later GPT-4 powered chat that was designed to use the Socratic method to aid student learning experience.

This basic CMS was used by students to supplement tutoring and provide and additional source of learning.
