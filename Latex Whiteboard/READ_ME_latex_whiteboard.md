# Latex Whiteboard

As mentioned in the introduction, STEM students had a difficult time communicating complex mathematical notation to GPT models. The default chat is convenient for ordinary users for daily tasks, but for STEM subject learning, it was 
not ideal. In mathematics and physics, students have to deal with a lot of different symbols and scientific notations that are very difficult to write on a keyboard to a simple chat. In order to solve this problem, we decided to
create a latex whiteboard, powered by MathQuill library

### benefits of MathQuill
MathQuill provides users an intuitive way to write mathematical symbols. When students write on the whiteboard, the complex notation, such as d/dx(2*x^2) is automatically converted into a Latex expression, which is what students
are more used to and write at school. 
This whiteboard makes it more convenient for students to interact with the latest AI models and seek material clarification, explanation and have their questions answered.

### whiteboard connected with GPT models
The whiteboard was connected to GPT models to make the communication more natural between students and AI. Whatever students write on the whiteboard, that content is sent to the GPT model along with the custom student message on that AI Chat.
By utilising various prompt engineering techniques, the model was instructed to inspect the whiteboard with latex notation and provide with constructive feedback.
